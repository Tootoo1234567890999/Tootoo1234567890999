- 👋 Hello hello. You can call me @Tootoo1234567890999
- 👀 I’m a gamer turned programmer (who still games) - I've always been interested in understanding how my favourite games worked!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... programming!
- 💞️ I’m still learning a bunch, so soon I'll be able to collaborate on a bunch of programming related stuff!
- 📫 How to reach me: Reach out your hand... Now there's a tiny, miniscule chance that I'll be there (Don't bet on it though)
